# What is this project?
This is an Express app that considers a `postgresql` database and renders a web interface to _query_ as well as _show the results_ in pretty format.

# How do I configure it to query my database?
If you're a developer and want to set up manually, simply find the `.env` file and change `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` formatting to meet your database information.
<br />
For other users, this can be done soon through the demo by simply inputting the `database` information in the web interface.
